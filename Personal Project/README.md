# My Personal Project

##  JavaGotchi 
JavaGotchi is a simple virtual pet game, where you interact with your pet to keep them happy, healthy, and full.
 
I decided to design JavaGotchi as I wanted to make a game that can be enjoyed by   
anyone, regardless of how busy they are or how much time they want to spend  
 per gaming session. JavaGotchi represents my first real foray into a large-scale (mostly) independent programming project.
Even if I wasn't able to implement a lot of excessive features I was hoping to, the project helped me learn and demonstrate proper coding style
and etiquette, and keep my code organized, proper, and documented while maintaining an independent workstyle and pace. In addition, JavaGotchi
is a simple test of more technical skills like JSON writing and reading, embedding and playing audio files in java, and simultaneous graphical user and command line interfaces.

(ADDENDUM: TURN DOWN your volume before testing the game out, especially with headphones! The playsound() component can be startling if you're not expecting it)


## Reflection:
With more time to work on my project, I believe I would not spend much time refactoring. Although the current layout of
having an entire classes dedicated only Pet, Cheeseburger, and Tiramisu, objects that never have more than one 
instance present, seems unnecessary and awkward, these were design choices with the idea of having multiple types/instances of
pets with independent stats/favorite foods, and multiple instances of Foods with different stat-restore values, based
on various factors. Therefore I would use the extra time not to refactor my design to make it make sense in the 
current situation, but rather add the features that would make my design a valid choice.
