# JavaGotchi
JavaGotchi is a simple virtual pet game, where you interact with your pet to keep them happy, healthy, and full.
 
I decided to design JavaGotchi as I wanted to make a game that can be enjoyed by   
anyone, regardless of how busy they are or how much time they want to spend  
 per gaming session. JavaGotchi represents my first real foray into a large-scale (mostly) independent programming project.
Even if I wasn't able to implement a lot of excessive features I was hoping to, the project helped me learn and demonstrate proper coding style
and etiquette, and keep my code organized, proper, and documented while maintaining an independent workstyle and pace. In addition, JavaGotchi
is a simple test of more technical skills like JSON writing and reading, embedding and playing audio files in java, and simultaneous graphical user and command line interfaces.

(ADDENDUM: TURN DOWN your volume before testing the game out, especially with headphones! The playsound() component can be startling if you're not expecting it)
